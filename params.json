{"name":"Ccv-object-tracking","tagline":"User-Defined Blob Detection And Tracking in CCV.","body":"In my application I propose to introduce Object/Pattern tracking into CCV in which the object/pattern to be tracked can be completely defined by the user.\r\n\r\nThe deliverables of this project will be:\r\n\r\n1.  A tool for selection of templates, where user can select the particular template to match\r\n2.  Template matching integrated into CCV.\r\n3.  Making an MT application to get and send data over Bluetooth/ Wi-Fi network.\r\n4.  Application for demonstration. Where you can transfer images from your MT screen to device just by moving it into the device region on the screen. This will be one use out of many, but will be the best for demonstration purpose. \r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n![Demo](http://db.tt/JBB783zQ)\r\n<br/>\r\n***\r\n<br/>\r\nChangelog (after CCV-COT):<br/>\r\n* Complete Fiducial Support (Integration of ofxFiducialFinder addon by Alain Ramos).\r\n* TUIO XML messages bug solved.\r\n* CCV Debug mode\r\n* Different Filter chain and controls for Fiducial and Object/Fingers.\r\n* Fiducial settings on config.xml file.\r\n* Object acceleration calculations included.\r\n* Removal and inclusion of some keyboard controls.\r\n* Closing of application from the “X” button,minimizing the application.\r\n* Changes in GUI\r\n* Blob counter for Finger, Fiducials and Objects respectively.\r\n* Sample AS3 app to test Custom Object Tracker(COT) added.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nOriginally hosted [here](https://code.google.com/p/google-summer-of-code-2010-nui-group/downloads/list)\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nGSoC 2010 project\r\n<br/>\r\n[![GSoC 2010](http://db.tt/3SNsY3Nv)](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2010)\r\n<br/>\r\n**Student:** Amit Kumar Sarangi\t\r\n<br/>\r\n**Mentor:** Christian Moore","google":"UA-38848919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
